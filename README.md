## Hi, Iâ€™m Alex!
I'm new to coding. Started with Python this January as a part of big course of **Data Analytics** at [SkillFactory](https://skillfactory.ru), so here you'll find mostly training projects from that platform.  
I've finished the course so far and got my [certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XAAuuXc1EBYf-igxcXAGQPP56d6VV3i3/view?usp=sharing). Haven't decided yet should I jump into machine learning or focus on business or financial analytics.
